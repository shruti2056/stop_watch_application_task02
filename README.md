From this task, I learned how to build a fully functional and user-friendly stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I explored how to create interactive features like start, pause, reset, and lap recording by using JavaScript functions and time management methods such as `setInterval` and `clearInterval`. I also learned how to enhance user experience by adding sound effects through the HTML5 Audio API, providing audio feedback for each button click. Additionally, I implemented a dark mode toggle using CSS variables and JavaScript, which helped me understand how to switch between themes dynamically while maintaining a smooth user interface. Overall, this project deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, responsive design, and creating engaging web interfaces.
